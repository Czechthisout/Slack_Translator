# Tasks App

ðŸš¨ This app is under active development. ðŸš¨

Tasks App is a sample Task Management app built on the [Slack Platform](https://api.slack.com). To learn more about it, check out this [blog post](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/blog/developers/sharpen-development-skills-tasks-app) or watch this ongoing series of videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWlXaxtQ7fUb0B4uNTKirvrQ0JOTCBFae).

As Tasks App is a tool designed to teach you about the Slack Platform, we don't currently offer a hosted version. If you're looking for a project management tool for your organisation, check out the many options available on our [App Directory](https://my.slack.com/apps/category/At0EFY3MJ4-project-management).

We've begun development using Bolt for NodeJS, but plan to eventually support all of the languages we provide an SDK for.

If you want to see the app in action, there's some screenshots below, or you can clone the repo and run it locally.
