# Tasks App

ðŸš¨ This app is under active development. ðŸš¨

Tasks App is a sample Task Management app built on the [Slack Platform](https://api.slack.com). To learn more about it, check out this [blog post](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/blog/developers/sharpen-development-skills-tasks-app) or watch this ongoing series of videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWlXaxtQ7fUb0B4uNTKirvrQ0JOTCBFae)

We've begun development using Bolt for NodeJS, but plan to eventually support all of the languages we provide an SDK for.

If you want to see the app in action, there's some screenshots below, or you can clone the repo and run it locally.
